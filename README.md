# Live Demo – Better Justification for the Web

This is a live demo corresponding to my master thesis on »Better Justification for the Web«. It simulates a simple, greedy line breaking algorithm and adds several parameters like variable fonts and experimental OpenType ligatures to improve the typesetting.

Please note: The algorithm not meant only for educational purpose and not for production. Performance is really bad since I wrote it in jQuery.
